00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Users in order of millions or in order. Tens of thousands accessing the services at the same time. You should be prepared with.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So you can imagine that. Doseen are yours. You know, isolation is not S and who can see each other's uncommon changes what sort of you know.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Chaos would happen. Okay, so in order to prevent that KS from happening So isolation should be a must.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
These type of businesses.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Okay, so this is also why isolation should be. Actually complied with. So. Let's maybe have a look to be.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And it says well.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That's the grab this one.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Okay.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Okay, so we say that both of the system based on their businesses, which are online businesses that businesses may need to serve a large number of customers at any time.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And for achieving consistency. Be required that the transaction does not see. Values of the other

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So. One way to achieve this is to only let a single transaction. Into the platform or Grant is single transaction access to do some stuff.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
In the platform. Which is, you know, a basic night approach.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But, although you know, Itchieve. Is isolation property and satisfy that.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But it do heavily impact efficiency of the service.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Okay, so imagine that. Tens of thousands are going to access the online banking system. And you are applying this one at a time.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Approach. Okay. So we can, you know, people. If they want to check their I count.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000
What do you do to do the same then I can go and check. It would be, you know, massive drop in.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Users that's function in Turn it on, No, the response time and so on.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Okay, so we actually. Want to achieve like that isolation. Okay.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So don't want to. Show inconsistent, daughter to the user, but at the same time he also wants to achieve a high limit.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Efficiency while also maintaining consistency. And that's why this topic of isolation is becoming, you know, a key.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000
No concept doesn't waste management system because no. It's very crucial. Platforms to work properly.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:41.000
At the same time, it's not very trivial to. Implement and, you need to put some efforts into that.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Any questions here?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So we're going to. Talk more about different types of. Isolation you know stats genes that can help with concurrency at the same time.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
No, doesn't kill efficiency.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Any questions?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Let's jump into the next question. So in this question we have a bank with millions of customers.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So this bank wants to provide the bonus, each of its customer. Yeah, bonus is updated in the database.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:36.000
That's a section as you can see here. So, want to discuss example and associate issues that can happen in such an approach.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Okay. I want to discuss it's a good choice. To use this.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Okay, maybe for this fund.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
2 to 4 min again. Just stay on this question before we can jump. The next slides.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You know for that transaction we make these slides

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And then review this question as well. If you want to process a million. Records to this transaction. Feasible reasonable or there are some problems associated with it.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Okay, any ideas?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000
How did you go with this question? Any ideas?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Okay, again, June. Sounds good. Choice seems if an ever happened at some point in the loop, the entire section will be, Let me go.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Okay.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I mean, I do both sick and pod. Still affect the consistency of the data.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Because if you are rolling back you are actually undoing all the changes right so you don't commit changes and this that is system should remain the same.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Basically.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Any other ideas?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
No, it's not about being wrong or right. I'm just, now we're having a discussion too.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Contact. You know, to just check our understanding. There again, nothing.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Please. When you're posting the

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Answer. Nothing is wrong. Discussing. Don't say that.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Okay, any other?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
To use

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So first of all, let's check what happens if we follow this plan section. So we begin the war.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
For each customer. So this is basically a for loop that you're doing.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Is for loop or, calculate the bonus. Yeah, basically.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Calculating bonus here to be your basically Updating the account values. Okay, so you're doing this for 1 million records.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So let's assume that as the 1,500,000 reports. Definitely smart, but actually eating a crash and whole frap transaction next to no crash.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So since you didn't save the walk any better. Good. In a redoing what you've done, which is a vase this compute tower.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
At least of time. And basically.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Which we doesn't want that.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:13.000
So what's the remedy? In this situation. So you can add some. Save points, default transaction.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Okay, when you're doing with millions of reports. And that will not distinguish. To that transaction with save phones from a classic.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
That's nice.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Okay.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:38.000
So yeah, basically, this is like too risky because in the case of a failure. Maybe we'll have lots of a listed compute power.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
That's a waste of time.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Which is not ideal for us.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Any questions here?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:01.000
But it will not actually impact the consistency of the data because if the You know. If it changes are not committed.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And you know, have a crash. In the middle of the transaction all of the oncoming changes would be rolled back so none of them will become doable Nothing. Stay.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I mean, in the standard dollar base is a rubble change.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Okay, any questions here?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Okay, cool. Thank you very much.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Now, let's check what happens if we add some safe ones. To the

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:58.000
To the selection. So this is the case. When we add some Save points. So this is for that transaction at some save points.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Sorry, want to see what happens. Yeah, Yeah, we assume that, in the following to a transaction, the condition is satisfied.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000
So the condition they can assume that it's true. And So finally you also do commit the work.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Okay, but under these 2 conditions but the printed value of accounts. That we'll have at the end.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Okay, maybe again. 3 to 4 min to stay on this question. So this is when we wanted to see what is the impact of adding the safe points to 2 to 2 min or 2 or 4 min to stand this question then we'll get back CBN set.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Okay, thank you for your input again. She can, So. Also are receiving some.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Reactions from the cloud which is really good.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Oh, no, actually. In.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So he's becoming. Like Yeah.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Is like. Replacing some students that come today.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
With extra reactions.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So maybe it's jump into the question to see. What happens in this scenario?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Any more ideas?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So it looks like that everyone is agreeing with. 21, spin final output.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Okay, so let's start from the beginning. First of all, at this point, S the That's fine.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Can be safe here. 4, yeah. So when we save the board, it's like you can imagine that those changes are committed.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And pushed to the to the dollar list okay then be again. Increase the But you of the count so again this is some on coming to changes but honestly save the world all of that changes will also become committed and they'll become Then we'll increase the value account again in the app.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.000
5 more so we started with 10 at 10 more so at this point we have 20. Okay. 20.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Then we have 25 here.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Then, yeah, save it again. Then 5 more so you will have 30 here.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Okay. And then finally, at this point, we're going to roll back the full concept. Okay.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:23.000
What's the ruling bank to save point 4, but number 2. Or, yeah, save point number 2 actually.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So when we, go back to that point. It means that all of the committed changes at that point.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Are going to stay. In the database and the rest what has happened after that we're going to ignore it Okay, so basically what has happened between the point that you do the rollback to the safe point and the safe point.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
So starting from here. Hop to the safe point which is here, everything that has happened, you can imagine that it has not happened or it has never happened.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:10.000
So we can ignore all of these. Operations here. Okay. It has been rolling back to the coming to changes at these points.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And at that point, the value of the count was 20.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Okay, beneath that.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Here, before executing the accounts equal to count plus one. Your account is actually equal to 20.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And then the add one more to the count. The value of count here becomes 21.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Okay, go ahead. To disregard this.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Okay, 21. And then we come into work.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
So at the point of commits or before the commit when they have trained and I'll use, 21.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:04.000
So well done. Chi, and, and, Any questions here?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Okay.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Any questions?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Oh cool. Let's move to the Last question of the first part of the. TED tutorial.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So in these parts. We're going to talk about this transactions. So before we jump into This, question of message transactions.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:58.000
We're going to briefly discuss. What is And message transaction and what are the rules that govern There we go, message transactions.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
So in different transactions, we have the parent transactions. Okay. So we have time here. Karen.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Oh, sorry.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So we have here. And then this parent will have some children.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:32.000
That's okay. So these are like you can say T one.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
. To and one. Okay. So.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:48.000
There are some rules when it comes to this. So first, the first rule is that children should always follow pattern and follow parents in a robot.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So if kind of rolls back.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Means it doesn't commit or undo all the changes then all of the transactions all of the children should also to the robot.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Okay. That is the first. So children always follow. In the rollback.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
The second rule is if the parent commits Okay, the children can commit or can roll back. So it's up to them.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:33.000
It's not No way. On the children's side. But if children commit and their parent also commit then coming to the children will become durable so you can.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Good. Means if the parent commits and children also commit. Committed to the children become durable.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
But they are not enforced to commit. Okay, it's up to them if they want to commit or roll back.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:58.000
So these 2 are basically the 2 rules governing. Missing transactions. Okay.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So with those 2 rules, we want to. Check these questions.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So we have 4 transactions, a parent and 3. You know children transactions and want to see what will happening.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Super polling scenarios. So each of the comics will become durable and each transaction is needed to roll back.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:40.000
So the first scenario. Children commit and turn roll back in the second one of the commit the third 1 2 of the children, one of the parent commits and You had to jump in.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:36:10.000
So maybe 5 to 6 min with the next question. And then we'll get back here to see the answer.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Okay, thank you very much everyone. So have lots of feedback. So. She can't please think.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Discuss.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Okay, As you can be saying first A BMC Okay, for, The second case none, Okay.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Okay. We roll back. The second case, done. And it is also not.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Well done. B, it's also saying 4 school Mac. Probably means. I'm taking it there, so it's not.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Okay.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:44.000
So just wondering if there is any order to do the commits like parents have to go first and then the children to react or vice versa.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:53.000
It depends on how they are actually being executed the order of the execution of them. But you usually depend.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Last. So it's like, It goes. And then it kind of disagrees with children rolling back.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:11.000
All of the children needs to also go back. Okay. Cool. So let's, start the first part.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So the first one says The parent is rolling back. And Sure. Committing. So due to the first move.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And this is If the pan rules back, all the children need to follow the term. In holding back.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Okay. So I'm in this case actually only to go back so all go back.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Okay.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:48.000
So we can say, oh, we'll need to roll back.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And then in the third case, there is no between the parents and children in the commit. So actually this is all good.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And in third case we have 2 of the children and the parents green so we have the parent here.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
We have one children. She's okay. Have other children. She's also okay.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:29.000
We have the children which is not okay. And then the parent is also okay. We know that. When the parent is committing Children can commit or not phone.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Okay, so it's okay. 4 C to roll back they can go back But if, like the children commit, they're coming to Google.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Okay, I'm doable because the parent has

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And the coming of this one will also become doable.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Assuming that the parent doesn't have any Okay. So then the last case only see. Needs to roll back and the rest can It's over.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Okay, so this marks the end of the first part of the Terry. Yeah, maybe take a 10 min break.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And then we can get back here. The second part of. So remember, please get, 10 min great.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
We can start 4 20.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And ultimately, 4 20. Continue with the second part to tell you. See you soon.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Okay, hello and welcome back real part so let's start this again part material So first we have a Christian from the from.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Being sure saying that for a question 4 of the trees in C. Build back. Own initiative.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Is it still count as forced to roll back? No. Because it was its own decision. The first call back is only when

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You know the children are Meeting parent goes back so children due to the missing transaction rules need to go back.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
That is a force.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Now that's, moving to the next question, which is about The Bulk and the Pavilion.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Okay, so first of all, let's discuss what we're and then we can get into, So any.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Any idea? Dead lockings. Or when the like happens actually.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Can you use the chat area?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Okay, so any ideas so far? 1, 2 min for YouTube. Raising your ideas on what

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Okay, so that luck happens when 2 transactions actually wait for one or another differently. Or for, you know, extended.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Period of time. 4. Especially without any end. Okay.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So it happens in 10 s when you know. there are like 2 different resources that these 2 transactions are dealing with.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So the first one. Put a log on the Hi, this resource. Take into a section between lock on it.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Second resource and then. First transaction wants to get a lock on the second resource.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And at the same time, the second time, the second, the first resource. Okay. So it's like, if we draw it.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Would be something like this. So we have transaction T one. I can't.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
. 2

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So basically there are 2 resources you can say. Hey. And Okay, so maybe let's put them.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
The middle.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So now let's assume that's transition t one get. Class section 2. Now in your transaction T one also wants to get Since the 2 only got it, so it needs to break.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Okay. And if. He too also wants to get a . One already a lock on it, it also needs to be.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Okay, so in this case T one is waiting for to release the and T 2 is also waiting for T one to release A and none of then can actually commit.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And they will actually wait for one other in for partner. Extend it to your plan.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Okay, but now we want to you know more formally or using my medical language see what is the Purple to that and then the situation actually.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Thanks. Cool.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So we start by. Sitting. Like a number. Transactions as well and also to the number of So what's the whole say?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Let's assume that we have n plus one transaction.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And be, you know, take one of the as a transaction that we are talking about and the rest of the entered sections.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So we also assume that we have total are capital bonds. And each transaction can get at most you know small not so Actually, when the transaction starts.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:24.000
They hold back 0 locks and as they you know proceed to the finish they hold our line okay so from 0 to R.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Not they can get at most are not. Each transaction can get. So in average, transactions have R or 2 locks approximately.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Okay, so this is the approach, the average number. This transaction can have. And then we have 10 of those transactions.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:54.000
So we have 10. Times r over 2 as the total Number 4, the average number of logs that is taken by the 2 sections.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Okay. So now, let's assume that we want to.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You know, get in lock on. One of the resources. So what is the probability that the, you know, conflict is one of the existing blocks so that is the number of existing dots over total So the probability that the transaction that you are talking about leads for a lot The number of the average number of box

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:47.000
which is NR over 2 or the total number. Logs, machines, capital. And then about these particular, you know, The section that you're talking about if we you know calculate the opposite The probability date doesn't wait for It will be, on-indus.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And R. Okay, and then we know that Eastern section. Wants to get at most our locks so the probability that Doesn't wait at all in its lifetime.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Who's the same value? Not's waiting for it. The power of R. Okay, so it would be one minus.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Hey, the cover of car. And then based on the calling equation, you know, that we can simplify.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:29.000
This is Okay, so we can put it as one minus and or 2 or 2 are. That's the probability that the particular transaction you're talking about.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Doesn't like that or not. And then the probability that the particular transaction rates It's lifetime will be.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:48.000
One minus this, this would be one minus p or one minus one minus 10. Hard to pull up to a tour which will give us and multiple 2 or 2.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Is the probability that the legal transaction base? In in its lifestyle for some. Okay, and then now you say this.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000
We can get the probability that 2. Transaction T which is the particular transaction of we are talking about.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000
How are the trans section tones? And the probability of the block of T, you already know that.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And R over 2 R and R 2 B to R, you put it there. And then the probability that another transaction.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Great for this transaction for this particular transaction team. He's the probability of, you know, in its lifetime over n.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Guys, this is a they, you know, in its lifetime or all of the other transactions.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And if it wants to wait for a specific transaction, you need to divide it by n. So to do that, when we find that.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Good'll get the probability that this particular transaction T. Waits for some other transaction T one. Okay, this is only for 2 transactions and if you want to do it for all the transactions you just need to multiply to end another time So you have 100, the power of 2 if you want to.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You will get the expendable of to port. 4 or 2 as the Okay. If we go back, we started with assuming that.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000
They haven't post one transactions. We put one of them side as the particular translation we were talking about.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And then we set for the rest of them, they assume that our total number. Our likes here and.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:44.000
These transaction can get at most are small runts in their iPhone. They will have a I'm gonna go over 2.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Total number of n times over 2 up. Hello, and then the probability will be How about waiting for a large would be the number of licenses already acquired by other transactions or total number of locks which is this.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And then by that we cut the probability of not making and then poverty of not waiting at all and also ability of waiting for some time.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Based on automotive waiting for 2. Transaction and then move. Get it for. For, giving it for general case.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Okay. Any questions here?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Okay.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Let's jump into the next question during this question we want to see here. Each of the following 2 transactions can end up in that situation.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Okay.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So you're just running these operations for interesting transactions. You may think of any possible overlap of execution.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Transactions every 2 transactions. And then we want to see each of the 2 we can follow up. Into a Maybe 2 to 3 min or 2 to 4 min.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then walk it back here to see the answer.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Okay, thank you everyone. So we have t 24 from jinkle on my also Shimmy, So let's see.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So first of all, what's the, you know, the current is it? Or 2 transactions to fall into the block.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Okay, what's the

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I mean some of the some transactions can never end up in 2. Finish. Or can end up in

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Any ideas?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Okay, so first of all. 2 translations can end up in the deadlock if and only if they are using the same set of resources.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.000
They're not using the same sort of resources. There's no chance. Here we have T one, we also have T 2.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So T one and T 2 are doing sort of resources. I see and T 2 is working with A and B.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Okay, so there is not possible. For these 2.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So similarly T 3 and T 4 can never encompass Okay, or T one and T 4 can never end up.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So now we only need to consider 2 pairs. T one.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:45.000
You need to consider the T one. Teach me. And T 4 8.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Okay, so now let's take it to one and t 3. Do they fall into a So if one goes first and T 3 goes second, you can also assume that.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Other day around but since the 2 are the same Doesn't matter which one goes first, right?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:14.000
So if you assume that T one is going first. Lock and see at this point. And now it's, imagine that T 3 right after that you'll get the floor.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So they also want to put in look and see, but since. T one only has a lock on C.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000
What do you want to finish? Okay. So then T 3 will wait here.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So they will wait here. One, T one, finish. 21, they'll finish and we'll actually at the end of that just before they commit, release the lock at this point.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:55.000
So at that point, So I have to get that gets the lot. There is no. This one has already finished until 3 will continue.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:09.000
The process and So, Oh good, we need to. Can you do the replacement t 2 and t 4 and one together?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So let's assume that first, T 2 gets Dock on A at this point right after that before it gets.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Okay. Then, T 2, write something in A. And then T 4, you'll also run something to B.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And then Teacher will try to lock on me, but. Since, T 4 already not be.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:50.000
So here, until needs to rate, right? The And at these points. We can see that T 4 also needs to pay because it wants to put a lot on A.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Breach. See you only be able to walk on. So. We're also.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And so then the 2 do actually wait for one another to release a lot But since they are like waiting for each other.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:15.000
They've been wait indefinitely for now infinitesimal For you have time. We just called it.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So this is a good luck situation.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Okay, and if you go to the other way around starting the T 4 the same will happen they will again end up in Execute one coming from T 4, one from T 2, again one for T 2.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
To see how they end up in

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Cool. Any questions here?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Any questions? Now let's go into the next.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Thank you.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Question 7. So isolation property in asset properties states that each transaction should run without being in there or in difference with another transactions.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Okay. So we want to pull the solution. For achieving isolation. So the solution is if we.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Use a, you know. A big lock for each transaction that gets into the memory. You too. That the whole database.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The whole other base. Oh, I putting the big black payer transaction that is running. Then what will happen?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Okay. Is this a ideal solution to or getting our estimation working or not?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So we can review why this may not be an idea solution. So again, so We discussed what my solution is, why it is important for you know different applications.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And now we are suggesting some new approach.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Okay, so we just want to see if that approaches. Something feasible or not.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So I'd be 2 to 4 min just to ask questions. Then we'll get right here to see the answer.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Okay, any ideas? Thank you very much. So some input is coming. So we start Stephen.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:52.000
In this case when one transaction is running, no other transaction which can run. Although you can achieve the isolation property.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Yes. That's right. The point. So then we have Jean, means every time I only execute one transaction which means decrease the performance.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Every transaction. Should wait for the previous one to one lot. Data. They'll increase the yes that's also right may take too long to process many transactions This transaction may not be going with the same type of rules, so volcano or Latin, fast.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Yes, that's also a very good point. . Okay, all of you were right.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So this is actually very same that the One at a time, solution that be proposed at the end of the start of today's material, right?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000
So we saw that, in banking and shopping systems. If you apply that one at the time.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Policy. You actually deteriorate your performance. Thank you. For the Third year transaction to be finished, which is not feasible.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Reality But you know this is one of the, this, this was another boarding of that simplistic approach.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And by itself. It's a simplistic approach. But, one of the key.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Shortcomings of these approach. Is the basic resource that it creates. Okay. You know, as, Richie and actually, So this is very pessimistic.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Assuming that every 2 transaction is going to. Access the same sort of resource and end up in a situation that we have there's a read of there to but that's not necessarily the case.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:01.000
So we can have many transactions that are like totally, working with different set of resources as we've seen in the previous network example, right?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So in those cases, we don't need to do that. And then when we have you know transactions are both in the same sort of resources.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Please, is very, you know. Has a very big overhead. And the running time.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:32.000
You know, totally impacted the negative bay. So that's why. Potentially at the So, but yeah, this is one of the first.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You know. Concurrent sequential models. Which we can name and you know, as we said, so the downside of that is that it's actually based in lots of resources such as I know.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:02.000
CPU you will have you have That's so on. So even in single CPU situations, you prefer some speed up using concurrency then.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Sticking with please. Conservative approach.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So in overall, we always want to achieve, isolation as we discussed in the first question.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:33.000
So achieving isolation is ideal. And actually is the requirement for us. By the same time, we don't want to you know, sacrifice the performance because performance is also as important to us and to maybe businesses as the I mean, as the consistency.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Okay, and the solutions should not actually work as you know, reasonable solution. That can work in practice.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Cool. Any questions here?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Any questions?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Now it's moving. Next question, which is the last question of the second. So we have.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:13.000
We want to actually come up with an example. So we have a new policy for dealing with. So previously we said, okay, so let's.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Do it one by one. The first question we said, let's do it one at a time.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:31.000
We saw that now the impact is very big. And it's not feasible then they said okay so let's come and the big lock on the database and then we said no that's actually saying to the one at a time you don't want to use that.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Peter, now in the third approach we want to do some concurrency that by now implemented the following.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:52.000
You know, approach. In this approach we are, you know, using One not, okay, pair operation.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So clear operation. A huge transaction. We use logs to make sure that concurrent access is done properly.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Okay. So yeah, so. Each operation basically. In the transaction discovered the appropriate lock.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And you want to see if that's enough for a achieving isolation when we run any 2.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:22.000
2 sections come currently Okay.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So this is actually one of the approaches that is being used in operating systems and it works fine. I want to see if that works one as well in.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:40.000
The base management system as well. So if you can give 2 transactions. Okay. That.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Can show that this approach does not always work as expected. That would be great. So again, you will have

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:58.000
. One You will have also T 2.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So, So you need to. You know do the you know overlay the operations. To.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Transactions in a bay that although then you know you have some operations, let's say you have this operation this is covered by the appropriate account You have another operation also.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Calling the appropriate log and you have also some operations here as well. So you want to open the operations of these 2 transactions in a way that it can violate.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Isolation in overall. Want to see if This, approach can achieve ISIS or if it's not enough yet.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:37:12.000
For achieving running town sections. Maybe. Yeah, 3 to 4 min on this question and then get back here to see you.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Okay, any other dues?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Can we use like these 2 transactions? Like. Every operation covered. Innovate that they you know.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
There to read. Okay, yes. How come?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Okay, Can you give an example?

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Okay, so when it comes to there to be basically you need to have transaction that is you know having right operation.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And then raise another Right operation over late, it means to write operation from best transaction. So The second one is actually doing it.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Read and write operation between the 2 right operations of the first transaction. Okay. It's also what I, like, wrote here so you can see.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:36.000
If you assume that those operations of the first one sections are Right operations. Then you transaction T 2 does some bright operation in between the right operations of the first transaction.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I'll go with them can be covered with an appropriate note. The whole thing is still violets.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Isolation. Okay, so let's have a look at Gene. Example, do you want to read?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Right, right. So yeah, you may also assume that they have like the appropriate like on top of each of the So, Okay.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:25.000
It should be 2 right on the same resource. I don't think that this one can Yeah.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Ring. We can.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
No, it cannot because you know If you have T one, right, in the example of Jean, everyone.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Please have a look to that.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Chat area. So first of all, in one transaction you need to have 2 writing points on the same resource.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:54.000
None of your translations has 2 right parts at the same resource. Okay. So it looks like the T one.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Is writing something on A and then it's committing. Okay, all the changes to Hey, he's being committed, you know, similar to being committed.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Have to finishes the first right on A because there is no right coming up on A. So if, T 2 gets the phone.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
After that.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It's so good. I mean in terms of value of pay because T one is not going to change it any further and whatever G 2 changes that's all good And the same is.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:45.000
But now let's check. Like an example of the case the guy said so we have 2 right operations from one transaction and One right operation from the transaction that is overlay between these 2 right operations.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Okay.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Okay. Okay, so as you can see. So we have operation one to 4, operation 5 to 9.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:24.000
So in operation one to 4 we have one right one update of value a and operation report. Your reading, replacing the value, then in between that and between a lot of right operation that we have in operation 11 and transaction 2 is actually taking the floor is reading the value of A is of taking the value of A and writing it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:35.000
So when the transaction T one is getting the floor back, the value of A is not same as Then it changed it in operation 4.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:43.000
But that's why. That although we covered like these operations such as read such as Read and write.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:51.000
They all are covered with appropriate lodge. Yes, don't cover it in a perfect part, but it's still the whole thing.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000
It's fine. So it looks like that only covering the operations of the appropriate land is not enough.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:07.000
To achieve isolation in your current when you are concurrently running to town sections

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Okay.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:25.000
So again, you have 2 touch points. In 1, one here. And between these 2 touchpoints and another transaction comes and updates the value invited.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And this is ruining the whole. This is like by making up, isolation because this transactions reading some unchanged uncommitted changes from Class Action.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Okay, oh good

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:57.000
So. We take a 10 min another 10 min break and then after 10 min, 5 17, get back here.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Continue with the third part.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And probably finish this. Material as well. So see you in. 5, 17.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Okay, welcome back with one. So let's continue with So we begin to part with this dependence relation problem.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:11.000
So we have this history of the transaction that has been run. And the history we know that, that the transaction is run on you know it's done some operation on specific resources for instance theization t one is reading from.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:18.000
It's the other Transition T 3, it's writing on, and so on and so forth.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Okay, so

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And now we want to create this depends relation. So the current simulation basically is relation between 2 transactions when you know they are doing some completing operation on the

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Shared resource for instance this session t one is reading from object one. And this Transaction T 3 is also writing to option one.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:05.000
So the 2 town sections are having good. I'm clicking the operation on the same resource. And that creates a dependency relationship between T one and T 3 on the same object or one.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Okay. So you want to create like all of the possible dependency relations they just out there And then based on that, they create pinsi graph and then we can present the pens graph.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:41.000
You can comment on whether then the serial history. Or, there's a, Okay, so in the same way that we created the dependence relation between t one and t 3 please go ahead and Try to find all the other kinds of relations.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And also try to create the and simulation graph. So the difference relation graph basically create one note for each of the transactions Okay.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Like this.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:11.000
And then for instance here you have section T one having a penis with transaction t 3 on all one then if this is t one and this is T 3.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Then we just connect the 2.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So the one link will come out from Translation T one and we'll go up to Translation T 3.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Just the way that we right the transaction relation. Okay, so yeah, try to create the depends on relations and then try to also create the See graphs see if there's a bone hole or cycle in the pensi graph or there's or if there's a maybe 2 to 4 min on this question and then get back to

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:20.000
you. Yes.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Oh, sorry. So did you hear me talking about the answer of Question 9 and 10.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Okay, sorry for that. Yeah, okay. So, Probably I need to do it again. So thank you for telling me.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So yeah, so for this 1. 4. This question.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.000
So we first need to Come up with the

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Depends on relations so yeah your friends actually correctly mentioned how the penestrelation are driven So if you check here, we first need to start with.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Yeah, and the objects or the resources that the transactions are dealing with. So, the, first check for Transaction T one, it's O one.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So we go and check if any other Transaction is dealing with O one, you see that yes, D 2 is also delaying the full one.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And then we check if the operations are conflicting. This is also the case because, This is a.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
One

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And then we eliminate these 2. And then do the same for T 3 and T 2. So we say.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
For T tree.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:22.000
It is like writing an offline. Let's check if any of the transaction is. Doing any other operation on O 5 you see yes it's T 2 and it's a reading, yeah, we know that again reading and writing is conflicting.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So again, T 3 will have a T 2. And be right there as a defense relation here. So both of them will have a dependence relation on O 5.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:43.000
That they could do the fees to as well. Then the next would be P 2 is doing some writing and O 2 also.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.000
T one is doing some reading at all 2.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And we can see that. You know again the operations, reading and writing are conflicting and we can write it as a Pence relation between T 2 and T one on resource Just begin, be again.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:16.000
You could do the fat. And then the other 2, both of them are T 5, so a translation cannot have a answer relation between itself.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.000
And basically It's like doing, operations or separate resources that doesn't matter even if it was on the same resource.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Since it's like the same transaction doing these operations and also seems it's like only read operation, we can ignore that.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000
So we can ignore these 2.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Okay, that'll have these 3. It tends to relation. So now you can think of If you draw a graph and put one into team for Each of the 10 sections.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Then these relations will Talk about the pages. So you can see that one edge is going from T one to T 3.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Then one age is going from T 3 to T 2. And then one going one edge is going back from all the way from T 2 back to T one, right?

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Which means there's a warm hole or there's a loop. In the dependency graph. And therefore there is no Syrian history.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Okay.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Because of a warm hole or a loop that we can see. In the Okay, any questions here?

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Any questions?

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Let's move to the next question.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Hey, question 11.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:06.000
So assume the following 2 transactions. So we want to. Can see the 2 different running for the of the following 2 transactions.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:16.000
The first for the transaction T one for transaction one goes first and then transaction 2 goes and you may overlay, you know, the operations.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:23.000
As you fish, but they assume that no 2 operations can. Run exactly at the same time.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000
So one should go first and then the other one.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:37.000
So given these 2 transactions, we want to see What happens if transsection one goes first and then transaction 2 those?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:49.000
As opposed to the case when the section 2 goes first and then transaction 1. 1, 2, 2.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Okay, so yeah, so maybe 3 to 4 min on this question. So try to run transaction T one.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000
And when you're running, maybe you can alternate between one operation from. 21 and one operation.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:13.000
And run it this way to the end. Then come back and run it. The Translation T 2 first and 21 s.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I see what happens and what's the difference in these 2 cases.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Okay, so any ideas what happens if transaction one goes first? As opposed to translation 2 going first.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000
So let's check. Let's start with transaction T one.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Going first.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Save transaction T one goes first. It's first put an S knock here on A. Then let's assume that's right after the.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:27.000
You can install on any things. Not conflicting, that's so good. And that's actually T one again goes first.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Then Thanks, Locken. T 2 wants to go it wants to put an extra company in well but since session t one already for the next step.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I need this one next to great.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:52.000
That's the great. 1 s you want to finish. Contest section T one.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Is week from B. Bill, do some. Then find out.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Okay. So at this point then transaction. They want unlocks the transition. T 2 and finish the get an mix up on B and execute the reception.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:27.000
So basically, Transaction T 2 gets the go back and transaction one has committed. And therefore, what the Transsection T 2 does.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Dressive transaction doesn't matter. Because it will only vote with the committed changes from transaction to one.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:40.000
So in the case, Ben T one. First.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000
One goes first and then to second.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:59.000
You too. Okay, so now let's check the case when T 2 goes first and then Oops.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:24.000
So in the case when T 2 goes Hey, right after that, T one goes and You can just let an A that's all good because 2 translation PIN. It's not on the same resources.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:41.000
. One, what's the put in next lot on B, but since the 2 already got a start on B, transition T one needs to wait Okay, then t 2 will continue right and be

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Brighton B. And we'll also unlock So at this point the Translation T 2 unlocks section T one and kicks in.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And Take an then transaction, T 2 can get it over and and run this one, but if that's section 2 2 wants to Get them.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Me to wait for. You want to finish. And release transaction. And release expects.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Dot com B right. So. But at this point when transaction T one is actually reading A so the value of A and actually bidding B the value of B has already.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:43.000
You know, updated. And has only been written. So this is this value of is reading at this point.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:55.000
There's actually some value that has already changed. So this is a day to week here. So you can say that this is a there to read at this point.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Okay. And This can create the power. So again, you can see that this reading and writing and B is happening.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Between 2 rights of B. We have so we have these 2 rights and then we have This one, Teams and this is the violation of the isolation.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:30.000
It is happening in this case. Okay. So yeah, so if done section, T one goes first and T 2 goes second, everything was fine, but other way around.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:38.000
T 2 goes first and then. He one goes. That's not okay.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Because as you can see. We can have there to read and also Any questions here?

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Any questions?

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Now let's move to the next question.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:09.000
So next question is about the degree of isolation.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:14.000
So you want to know what's the degree of isolation of the following transaction.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:20.000
So before, that we can quickly review what was the degree of isolation. So we have 4 degree of isolation.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:32.000
We have degree 3. Degree 2. One and B 3 0. Okay, so that's maybe quickly.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I did. 4. Degrees of isolation.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
So we have degree 3.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:24:02.000
So what what are the properties of it? So first of all, Well, with respect to

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Right.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And it is 2 phase.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Respect to

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:33.000
All locks. Okay. So what does well form means means therefore means that every reading or writing writing operation is, covered with the appropriate Okay.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:40.000
And 2 phase we just speak to all Dux means that we have one face for lucky. One Facebook unlucky.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And no locking operation happens after the first unbuttoning approach.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Okay, so then We go with degree 2.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:25:02.000
That relaxes. We could read to some extent. So it is still with home. Respect to.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Read and bright. But it is not no longer. 2 phase, sorry, 2 phase.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Is no longer too faith with respect to all the logs. It's only Only 2 phase.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:30.000
With respect to Thanks.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Okay.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:45.000
This is degree 2, then we also have degree one.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:58.000
So in degree one. It is only well form so we relax the property of their phone. So it's only Bell form.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Respect to Right. And it is. Only 2 days.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:15.000
To speak to. Exclusive.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Bucks. And then we also have degree 0.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000
They also have degree 0.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Hey, Cheese. Only well formed.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Just expect to.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Right. Okay. So this is how degree of isolations. Are defined and the this degree.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Actually handles all different types of conflict and then as we go down the list. So. They, you know, handle.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000
You were cases up until the

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:17.000
This case that only doesn't write on the dirty dot of another One section. Okay. But here we only want to work with you know, identifying.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:25.000
What is degree 3 what is degree 2 and how we can switch between these 2. So you can always need to check.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:37.000
The Boldphone property and whether it covers only the rates, the rights or some of them for both of them.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:48.000
And then you also need to check how it's covering, you know. Hi there it's two-phase, in a speak to all the logs or it's just to place in respect to exclusive logs.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:59.000
And so on. So let's jump into the Question 12. So we want to check what is the degree of isolation of comparing transaction.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Checking the well form property. Shaking if it's filmed with respect to read and write if that's the case It's at least decree.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:21.000
2 and then we need to check the 2 face property And if it's not, with respect to read and write, it is most the one.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Okay.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:40.000
So. Requiring Lee's saying, degree one. Retreat So maybe 24 min in this case.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Any other ideas?

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Okay, so any comment on the bill form? So is it the phone? Is it only, Oh, sorry, you just went to.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Any ideas?

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.000
So let's take the operations one by one.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:31:02.000
. Right So we have one group operation. That is covered with But here we have. One right operation is also appropriate.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Have which has the but this read operation. Doesn't have any. So it's at March, it's up to 3 1.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Now what's the difference between B one and between 0? It's only the 2 phases of the exclusive locks so here we have only One exclusive log, which is

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:35.000
And one exclusive bar by itself is always, 2 faced. So we can say that this is a different one.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
1 s.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Okay, any questions?

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Any questions?

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Now let's move to the That's the question of this material.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Just question to your team.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So we want to convert this degree to transaction into a degree tree transaction.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:16.000
How would you do that?

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:27.000
So we know that between 2 and degree 3 both are well formed with respect to course freedom rights. But degree 3 is, 2 phase with respect to.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:57.000
All locks and The 2 is only 2 phrases with respect to exclusive. So how can we convert this degree 2 to the query?

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Okay, so the only difference between degree 2 and degree 3 is the 2 for instance, right? So let's check which operation is actually violating the 2 for instance with respect to all the So we have this unlock on A.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:09.000
That is actually you know Rooney, the 2 faces because After that we have some lighting operating. So if you remove these on liking here and move it to the end of Transsection.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Okay, basically here should be all good. Right. Because after that, no more liking operation we had.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:34.000
And it should be all good. And to be still cover every operation with the appropriate logs of your nuts violating the bell form mess and you're adding the 2 businesses.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:42.000
To this transaction so it's like only removing the unlocking from here since we already have one on like here

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:49.000
And we can also remove the like you as well because

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.000
You have one at the top, so we have, you don't need to close it, keep it open.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:05.000
We remove this unlock, we also remove this and then all should be good.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Yes, yes, we also need to. So Gene Kwang Lee, yeah, we also need to remove the second slack as well because doesn't.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:24.000
You know, doesn't mean if you put 2 S like without

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Okay, this marks the end of today's stereo if you have any questions. Let me know.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Otherwise, have a great

02:35:43.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Thank you.
