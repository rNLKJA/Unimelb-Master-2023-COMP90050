00:33:37	Jinhong Mai:	The isolation ensures multiple concurrent transactions' execution are isolated from each other
00:34:30	Ziqiang Li:	isolation ensures that concurrent transactions leave the database in the same state as if the transaction were executed separately. Both businesses require consistency of data which isolation can ensure the consistency of data across multiple users
00:37:13	Ziqiang Li:	concurrent transactions
00:47:37	Jinhong Mai:	It is not a good choice since if an error happened at some point in the loop, the entire transaction will be rolled back and it will affect the consistency of the data
00:48:30	Jinhong Mai:	ok, I am wrong
00:48:52	Jinhong Mai:	Yep, I know that
00:51:45	Jinhong Mai:	No
00:54:39	Ziqiang Li:	21?

3..." with 👍
01:04:57	Ziqiang Li:	this is for rollback
01:05:08	Jinhong Mai:	i: A,B,Cand parent ii: none iii: none
01:06:22	Mingxiao Li:	(I) forced rollback; (ii) none (III) none
01:09:28	Mingxiao Li:	Just wondering if there is any order to do the commit? Like parent have to commit first and then the children can react, or vice versa?
01:19:28	Mingxiao Li:	For q4 (iii), since C rolls back with its own initiative , is it still count as “forced to roll back”?
01:27:55	Mingxiao Li:	Thanks

01:45:08	Steven:	Reacted to "T2,T4" with 👍
01:55:09	Steven:	In this case, when one transaction is running, no other transactions can run. Although we can achieve the isolation property, the overall performance is bad.
01:55:42	Jinhong Mai:	This means every time we can only execute one transaction which will decrease the performance and every transaction should wait for the previous one to unlock the data will increase the delay.
01:56:55	Rescian Rey:	It may take too long to process many transactions. Each transaction may not be dealing with same tables/rows, so more granular locking is faster.
02:07:35	Jinhong Mai:	dirty read
02:07:38	Jinhong Mai:	I think
02:08:47	Jinhong Mai:	T1: read A write A read B write B T2:read B write B read A write A
02:30:24	Ziqiang Li:	DEP(H) = <T1,o1,T3>,<T3,O5,T2><T2,O2,T1>
02:30:30	Jinhong Mai:	<T1,O1,T3>,<T3,O5,T2>,<T2,O2,T1> wormhole: T1-O1-> T3-O5->T2-O2->T1
02:30:36	Ziqiang Li:	no wormhole
02:31:02	Ziqiang Li:	oh, yes there is wormhole
02:35:32	Zhikai Wu:	you are muted ahmad
02:35:59	Ziqiang Li:	no
02:36:00	Jinhong Mai:	Nope

02:58:06	Jinhong Mai:	write
02:58:09	Jinhong Mai:	degree 1
03:01:06	Ziqiang Li:	maybe remove the 2nd slock A
03:01:20	Ziqiang Li:	and move the unlock A to the end
03:03:01	Zhikai Wu:	thankyou
