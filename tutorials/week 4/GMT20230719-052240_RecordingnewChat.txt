00:08:14	William De Michele:	Line 3, line 6, line 9 are unlocks that occur while there are still locks that are occurring.These should all be placed after line 10, the final lock
00:12:07	Min Shen:	34 => no two-phase lock on reading，67=> no two-phase locking? Not sure，9 10 => no two-phase lock on writing
00:14:18	William De Michele:	Alternatively could instead bring lines:7 and 10 to before 6
00:21:03	William De Michele:	Is it advisable to bring locks earlier, or release unlocks later??
00:21:23	William De Michele:	i.e. my first answer vs my alternative answer
00:23:19	William De Michele:	Clear
00:45:11	William De Michele:	U is compatible with S without delay, IX is not compatible with S giving a delay:IX is not compatible with U, causing a delay.Order will be T1 (S)-> T2 (U)-> T3 (IX)with T1 and T2 running without delay, and T3 being delayed
00:53:40	Lily Li:	Can we assume the order for ourselves
00:54:03	Ibrahim Ibrahim:	S and X are not compatible so t1 cannot go with t2 too without delay
00:56:56	Ibrahim Ibrahim:	When value of A=3*
01:00:12	Lily Li:	For these questions do we need to go through all orderings
01:00:29	Lily Li:	Or is it sufficient to discuss just one
01:00:38	William De Michele:	Sorry Ahmad I'm a bit confused about where I was incorrect?
01:02:05	William De Michele:	Doesn't the compatability suggest the order? Not sure why to not maximise compatability
01:03:06	William De Michele:	Okay sure thanks
01:03:20	Ibrahim Ibrahim:	When A = 2, t1 S goes first and still compatible with t2 U. But not compatible with t3
01:03:27	Min Shen:	T1 t2 run concurrently, t3 delay, as s is compatible with u, then lock status become u, then u will deny all;t1 t3 t2: s will deny the request of ix, but later can accept the request of u(in t2), so t1 t2 can run concurrent in this scenario but t3 still delay
01:03:55	Min Shen:	And a == 2, so if statement is always false
01:04:12	Ibrahim Ibrahim:	Ya.. agree
01:04:25	Min Shen:	😁
01:15:15	William De Michele:	First order: Only T1 & T3 can run because the IX prevents T2 from accessing FILE-2Reverse Order: All transactions can run, as T2 is able to share its IS with T1  ???
01:15:15	Min Shen:	Database:t1 t2,can run, t3 delay, status is IX; file-2: t1 t2 can run, status is IX, key-a(file-2):t1 t2 can run, status is S, other keys(file-2): t2 can run, status is S;
01:15:24	Min Shen:	For t1 t2 t3
01:15:34	William De Michele:	Not sure on this one tho
01:21:07	Min Shen:	So for t3-t2-t1
01:21:14	Min Shen:	Lower layers first consider t2
01:21:17	Min Shen:	Then t1?
01:21:39	William De Michele:	Is it possible to go over granularity again during this break, I am still confused
01:22:08	Min Shen:	Are all layers can be seen as independent?
01:23:18	Min Shen:	so for t3 t2 t1, t1 is delayed in DATABASE, will this influence the lower layers?
01:24:27	Min Shen:	So for each node, just consider them independently?
01:24:54	William De Michele:	Isn't IS compatable with IX and vice versa? Why does the ordering change which transactions pass?
01:25:15	Min Shen:	So if transaction is delayed in parent node, then this transaction in all child node will be delayed?
01:26:05	William De Michele:	Yes I am unsure why going from back to front changed the compatability
01:26:07	Min Shen:	Oh,so for t3 -t2 t1,just check database is fine?
01:26:39	Min Shen:	Reacted to "Oh,so for t3 -t2 t1,..." with 👍
01:26:55	William De Michele:	The order of transactions
01:27:42	William De Michele:	On the table both IX -> IS has a plus and IS -> IX has a plus. Am I interpreting this wrong, I thought it means they are both granted
01:30:53	William De Michele:	Oh okay I think I misheard the original answer then which lead to my confusion
01:32:19	Min Shen:	want higher efficiency, higher throughput

02:11:04	William De Michele:	U would become uncommited as it checks for the failure before commiting, which it would see that Y failed and would abort

02:43:08	Min Shen:	so only redo Len 30?

Ya I think there is typo
02:55:06	William De Michele:	### RedoScan forward through the log starting at LSN 30LSN 30: Read page P2, check PageLSN stored in the page.
